This project asked for skills with basic Javascript. Guidelines for different functions
were provided.

Thoughts after finishing the project:

This was fun! Spent maybe a bit too much time tinkering with details here and there, but it was all in the name of learning, and I did learn a good amount!

Lessons learned from this project especially:
  - '=' does not equal '==='. This is important to remember at all times.
  - One needs to be aware of what they are logging to the console: otherwise they might
    spend and hour trying to fix a function that was working perfectly to begin with.
