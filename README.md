This project asked for skills with basic Javascript. Guidelines for different functions
were provided.

-----------------
Thoughts after finishing the project:

This was fun! Spent maybe a bit too much time tinkering with details here and there, but it was all in the name of learning, and I did learn a good amount!

Lessons learned from this project especially:
  - '=' does not equal '==='. This is important to remember at all times.
  - One needs to be aware of what they are logging to the console: otherwise they might
    spend and hour trying to fix a function that was working perfectly to begin with.


Ideas for improvement after reviewing other people's solutions:
  - playRound() would be more concise by using OR, and ${choice variables} instead of
    typing every option out separately
  - I forgot that incrementing a value by 1 can be done with '++' instead of '+= 1'
  - some in game improvements, like:
       a welcome message
       announce the current round number
